      <description>MotivationI became interested in text mining after attending a talk by Julia Silge at the Portland R User meetup group. She showed off some of the concepts from her new book Text Mining With R: A Tidy Approach, coauthored by David Robinson. The book, which I highly reccomend, covers some of the fundamental techniques of text mining using tidytext, an R package created by David and Julia.
Text mining is of personal interest to me because I am often working open-ended survey data in my day job as a market research analyst.</description>
